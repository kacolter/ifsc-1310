    <h2>Thoughts on Web Accessibility</h2>
    <p>Accessibility is what will bring people to a website and keep them coming back. The more accessible your website is, the more potential there is for a wide array of people to use it. Especially across multiple devices, it's important to ensure that the website can function just as well on one device as it does on the other. 
      In general, it's important to ensure that any user could access the website. Bright colors and rapidly moving graphics, for example, can cause distress for some users. Certain fonts are hard to read and some color schemes are less harsh on the eyes than others. Even details like the color of a link can make it hard for a user to understand the purpose of it or that it actually is a hyperlink. Therefore, it's incredibly important to organize every aspect of a website with purpose and with the user in mind. </p>
    <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
    <p>Progressive enhancement is a concept that prioritizes the information/content of a website above all else. CSS and JavaScript are essentially the bow on top that pull the website together, but they may not be as accessible to users across all platforms. Not having a device that can process CSS and JavaScript the way it was written can damage the experience for the user, but there’s HTML to fall back on. As long as all of the content is purposeful and accessible, the CSS and JavaScript function more as a bonus for those with devices that can process it correctly. The accessibility is what makes progressive enhancement so vital for modern web development. Those who don’t have the newest browser can still have a good experience but those who do have a modern browser can have the best experience on a website that values progressive enhancement. Truly understanding the user experience, no matter what browser they have, will make for a great website.
