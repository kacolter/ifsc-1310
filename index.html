    <h2>Thoughts on Web Accessibility</h2>
    <p>Accessibility is what will bring people to a website and keep them coming back. The more accessible your website is, the more potential there is for a wide array of people to use it. Especially across multiple devices, it's important to ensure that the website can function just as well on one device as it does on the other. 
      In general, it's important to ensure that any user could access the website. Bright colors and rapidly moving graphics, for example, can cause distress for some users. Certain fonts are hard to read and some color schemes are less harsh on the eyes than others. Even details like the color of a link can make it hard for a user to understand the purpose of it or that it actually is a hyperlink. Therefore, it's incredibly important to organize every aspect of a website with purpose and with the user in mind. </p>
    <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
    <p>Progressive enhancement is a concept that prioritizes the information/content of a website above all else. CSS and JavaScript are essentially the bow on top that pull the website together, but they may not be as accessible to users across all platforms. Not having a device that can process CSS and JavaScript the way it was written can damage the experience for the user, but there’s HTML to fall back on. As long as all of the content is purposeful and accessible, the CSS and JavaScript function more as a bonus for those with devices that can process it correctly. The accessibility is what makes progressive enhancement so vital for modern web development. Those who don’t have the newest browser can still have a good experience but those who do have a modern browser can have the best experience on a website that values progressive enhancement. Truly understanding the user experience, no matter what browser they have, will make for a great website.

    <h2>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
    <p>Overall, I’ve had a good run over the course of the semester. I challenged myself by taking multiple coding classes with no prior experience and exceeded my own expectations. This class is the one that I excelled the most in. I found that I understood CSS the most, despite struggling with targeting the HTML at first. Once I actually started coding my final project, I realized that I understood more about both CSS than I had originally thought and succeeded in what I had previously struggled with. The design aspect makes the most sense to me because I can visualize it better than I can the information/HTML. The structure of HTML documents is a bit more challenging to me than that of CSS because it’s hard for me to understand what kind of ‘dividers’ (div, section, etc.) make the most sense to use for a specific aspect of the document. Ironically, I practiced HTML the most throughout the semester and ended up understanding CSS better despite not practicing it as much. 
    </p>
    <p>Assignment-wise, my final is definitely my best work out of all of the course work for the semester. I think I managed to have a good handle on how CSS and HTML work together and how every single aspect of the document has a purpose. I struggled a bit with graphic design as I’m not the best at navigating art platforms. However, I managed to do a good-enough job on this and that’s something that I can work on in the future. If I had to do anything differently, it would be making sure that my first HTML assignment had better structure. I think I was more so focused on meeting all of the requirements that I didn’t necessarily consider the purpose of each aspect of the document. If I had done that, I think it would’ve been a more effective HTML document than what I turned in.

    <p>I asked my Mom to review the first draft of my website and the only feedback she had was to change the positioning of my footer and to increase the font size. I did end up adjusting the footer’s position as it made my website look more organized. However, I did not change the font size because, if I had, I think it would’ve made the website not look as proportionate. She did say that the font size wasn’t too small for her personally, but she thought maybe it would be too small for someone else.
