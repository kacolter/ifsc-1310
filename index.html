    <h2>Thoughts on Web Accessibility</h2>
    <p>Accessibility is what will bring people to a website and keep them coming back. The more accessible your website is, the more potential there is for a wide array of people to use it. Especially across multiple devices, it's important to ensure that the website can function just as well on one device as it does on the other. 
      In general, it's important to ensure that any user could access the website. Bright colors and rapidly moving graphics, for example, can cause distress for some users. Certain fonts are hard to read and some color schemes are less harsh on the eyes than others. Even details like the color of a link can make it hard for a user to understand the purpose of it or that it actually is a hyperlink. Therefore, it's incredibly important to organize every aspect of a website with purpose and with the user in mind. </p>
